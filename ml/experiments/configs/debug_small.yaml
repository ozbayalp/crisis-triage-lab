# CrisisTriage AI - Debug/Quick Test Configuration
# =============================================================================
#
# Minimal configuration for quick sanity checks and debugging.
# Uses tiny batch size and few epochs to run fast.
#
# Usage:
#   python -m ml.src.training.train_triage_model --config ml/experiments/configs/debug_small.yaml

padding: "max_length"
truncation: true

# --- Data ---
# Use small subset or same files - will process quickly with small batch
