# CrisisTriage AI - Baseline BERT Configuration
# =============================================================================
#
# Standard training configuration for triage classification.
# Uses DistilBERT for efficiency while maintaining good performance.
#
# IMPORTANT: This configuration is for RESEARCH/SIMULATION ONLY.
# The resulting model is NOT suitable for real-world crisis intervention.
#
# Usage:
#   python -m ml.src.training.train_triage_model --config ml/experiments/configs/baseline_bert.yaml
